###NAO Random Race

The first way to interact with the NAO robot will be by using its camera and microphone. We will develop a game were a group of people has the goal of drawing the robot near them. But here is the twist: the players do not know how to do this, and they will have to collaborate to find out.

We will program several ways in which the robot will walk towards the players such as, but not limited to:

* when people talk to it,
* when people don’t talk to it,
* when people make big movements such as jumping,
* when people do not move, or
* when people show him a special color.

Once the game starts, the robot will pick at random one way in which he will advance towards the group of people. Once people start doing different things to it, such as talking or showing it a color, the robot will provide feedback on why that technique is not working. For instance, if people start talking to it, and that’s not what’s making the robot move, it could cover its ears. Similarly, if people start jumping and that’s not making the robot move, it could lean back and cover himself as if scared from so much movement.

###Web Interface

We will come up with a mobile interface for the robot, so that anyone who is not an expert programmer can control it in a simple way. We will design this interface and build it, where simple actions can be performed, such as moving in two dimensions and moving the arms.
